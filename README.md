# Python File Sorter

This includes two Python scripts for folder organisation and sorting:

**organise.py**
- Organises files in directory and sibling directories based on their file types. 
- Handy if you want to clean up an external hard drive or even your downloads folder.
- This is an extension of the original script created by sqordfish.
- 

**dups.py**
- This script will go through a folder a delete duplicate files with the same name but different file extensions.
- Handy if you need to clean up your music and have the same songs in multiple file formats.

## Examples
- Running organise.py in your Downloads folder ```python organise.py C:\\Users\User\\Downloads\\```

- Running dups.py in your Music folder ```python dups.py C:\\Users\User\\Music\\```

## Requirements
- Fiels were designed for Python 2.7.
- Scripts were run and tested in Windows but may also work for Linux.
